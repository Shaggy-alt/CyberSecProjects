The objective of this project was to familiarize myself with known vulnerabilities and see how they would be used in a contained environment.
with said knowledge be able to build counter measures/patch necessary apps & OS.

 - Eternal Blue is one of my favorite vulns, it exposed how many devices could be easily infected with little to no effort by sending modified packets 
to the victim machine. Windows had a vulnerability within the OS server message block. This has crippled entire sectors of industrial sites when combined
with wannacry.

 - SQL Injection is a very common

 - Brute force ssh using hydra

 - Reverse shell
