I will be using NMAP, Download here if you havent already: https://nmap.org/download

The goal of this project was to understand the difference between Footprinting & 
Fingerprinting with the knowledge on implementing them accordingly. 

Footprinting is scanning the entire network topology while 
Fingerprinting is scanning a specific target to gain further service type info etc...

NMAP IS EASILY DETECTED. UNLAWFUL USE MAY RESULT UP TO FELONY 
CHARGES.

You can always pull up the manual by using 'man nmap' or 'nmap -h' depending on OS.

Once installed you can start scanning specific targets or do a whole network scan. 
  -Targeted sweep: nmap 10.0.7.10   
  -Network sweep: nmap 10.0.7.1-254 

TO DO A FOOTPRINT: Since this is used to obtain info about a network topology, 
you will be using the network sweep version. Use any additional options like 
-sV -Pn and even any other scripting tools. Ex: nmap -sV -O 10.0.7.1-254

TO DO A FINGERPRINT: Used along side enumeration, you are gathering specific information 
on a specific target. You can use the same options, however I do recommend for testing 
security try to use avoidance techniques to ensure blue team strength. 
Ex: nmap -Pn -sV -vvvv 10.0.7.6

ADDITIONAL OPTIONS I LIKE TO USE:
  -Port Scanning techniques 
  -Service Detection
  -OS detection 
  -Host discovery
  -Evasion
  -Searching for NSE scripts with 'ls | grep ftp' I found to be helpful. 
  (cd into proper directory before grep command, for kali thats '/usr/share/nmap/scripts')

Said additional info can be found here: https://nmap.org/book/man.html
