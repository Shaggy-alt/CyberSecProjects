I will be using NMAP, Download here if you havent already: https://nmap.org/download

The goal of this project was to understand the difference between Footprinting & 
Fingerprinting and implement them accordingly. 

Footprinting is scanning the entire network topology while 
Fingerprinting is scanning a specific target to gain further service type info etc...

NOTE: DO NOT USE IN LIVE ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT EXPLICIT AUTHORITY. 
NMAP IS EASILY DETECTED. UNLAWFUL USE MAY RESULT UP TO FELONY 
CHARGES.

You can always pull up the manual by using 'man nmap' or 'nmap -h' depending on OS.

Once installed you can start scanning specific targets or do a whole network scan. 
  -Targeted sweep: nmap 10.0.2.10   
  -Network sweep: nmap 10.0.2.1-254 

ADDIONAL OPTIONS I LIKE TO USE:
  -Port Scanning techniques 
  -Service Detection
  -OS detection 
  -Host discovery
  -Evasion
  -Searching within NSE scripts 'ls | grep ftp' I found to be helpful. (cd into proper directory before grep command)
