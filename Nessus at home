Nessus can be installed on your home router. Download Home version here: https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials 

It provides an extra layer of protection by automating vulnerability scans, scan entire cloud structures and more :O 

The Home version has less support but it is free! Once through the installation process 
(which may take a decent chunk of time, mine took 30ish min. to complete) you now can scan your network up to 16 ip addresses!
